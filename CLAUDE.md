# Foxhue SuperClaude — Agency Template Framework

## Overview
Reusable project template for Foxhue client website builds. New client projects are created using GitHub's "Use this template" feature, then configured via `project.json` and scaffolded with `/scaffold`.

**GitHub**: https://github.com/ajeibbotson-cmyk/foxhue-superclaude
**Usage**: Template repo → "Use this template" → configure `project.json` → run `/scaffold`

## How It Works

1. Create a new repo from this template
2. Edit `project.json` with client details, brand tokens, pages, and design directions
3. Run `/scaffold` to generate all infrastructure files
4. Build design directions in `designs/design-{a,b,c}/`
5. Build website pages in `website/`
6. Build layout variants in `website/variants/`
7. Run `/seo-report` for competitor analysis
8. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Commands

### `/scaffold`
Reads `project.json` and generates:
- Root `index.html` (project hub)
- `designs/index.html` + `designs/styles.css` (design direction hub)
- `website/styles.css` (brand tokens as CSS custom properties)
- `website/variants/index.html` (client review hub with AJAX form submission)
- `CLAUDE.md` (project context — overwrites this file with client-specific version)
- `docs/client-asset-brief.md` (image/asset request checklist)

### `/seo-report`
Uses Perplexity MCP to research competitors and generate a branded SEO report:
- Finds 3-5 competitors via Perplexity search
- Deep analysis of each competitor's SEO, content, and local presence
- Gap analysis comparing client to competitors
- Outputs `docs/seo-competitor-report.html` — a client-ready branded report

## project.json Schema

| Section | Fields | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `agency` | name, primary_email, cc_email, github_org | Agency details for forms and deployment |
| `client` | name, short_name, tagline, slug, industry, location, phone, email | Client identity |
| `brand.colors` | primary, accent, accent_hover, background, surface | CSS custom properties |
| `brand.fonts` | heading, body, google_fonts_url | Typography |
| `designs[]` | key, name, mood | Design direction definitions |
| `pages[]` | key, title, slug | Website pages to build |

## Architecture Notes
- All generated files read from `project.json` — no hardcoded client data
- CSS variable prefix uses `client.slug` (e.g., `--marr-primary` for slug "marr")
- Review hub uses AJAX form submission via Formsubmit.co (stays on page)
- Images stored locally in `website/images/`, shared across website, designs, and landing
- All HTML self-contained with Google Fonts loaded via `<link>`
- Website breakpoints: 992px, 767px, 477px
- Landing breakpoints: 1200px, 991px, 767px, 478px
- Deploy to GitHub Pages from `main` branch
